helpers / filter_utils.py

Provides filtering and search functionalities for the movie database.

This module enables users to search movies by title, filter them based on rating and release year,
and interactively find a movie by name. All user interactions are handled with consistent
CLI feedback using colored output.

Functions:
- filter_movies_by_search_query: Performs case-insensitive substring search in movie titles.
- filter_movies_by_attributes: Filters movies by rating and release year and prints the results.
- find_movie: Prompts the user to input a movie title and confirms its existence.

These tools enhance the user's ability to quickly locate and extract relevant movie data.
