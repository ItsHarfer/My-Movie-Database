handlers.py

This module defines all handler functions for user-interaction in the movie database
application. These functions serve as the interface between user commands (e.g. menu
selections) and the core application logic.

Each handler corresponds to a specific action, such as adding, deleting, updating,
listing, sorting, or analyzing movies. Additionally, this module manages output
presentation and user input handling where appropriate.

The handlers are designed to be used in conjunction with a dispatcher (MOVIE_COMMAND_DISPATCHER)
that maps user commands to the appropriate function.

Main functionalities include:
- Adding, deleting, and updating movies
- Listing all movies or searching/sorting them
- Showing statistics and generating visualizations (e.g. rating histogram)
- Selecting a random movie
- Gracefully exiting the application
