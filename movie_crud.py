"""
movie_crud.py

Provides core CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing movies in the database.

This module contains functions to:
- Add new movies with flexible attributes
- Delete existing movies
- Update specific attributes of a movie

Each function works directly on the in-memory movie dictionary and provides immediate
user feedback through colored console output. The module focuses on modifying the
movie dataset based on user actions, and complements the higher-level handler logic.

Used primarily by menu handler functions in the application.
